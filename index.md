## Hal Milenkovic - Painting Ghosts Magic Leap Project

### 11/18/19 - Super Galaxy Knights: Archer Archives

The first iteration of the project is a Magic Leap One game titled Super Galaxy Knights: Archer Archives.

Super Galaxy Knights: Archer Archives is a mixed reality game set in the Super Galaxy Knights universe. The goal of the experience is to mix immersive 3D comic panels in with action gameplay, utilizing all the tools that the Magic Leap One has to offer.

The game is based off of [Super Galaxy Knights Deluxe R](http://sgkdr.thecomicseries.com/comics/), a comic that I have been drawing since 2016. Super Galaxy Knights was chosen as the property to base this game around because-

- I’m knowledgeable about the universe.
- It’s a property I own.
- Gameplay makes sense in the universe - it’s easy to tailor new characters’ magic powers to the capabilities of Magic Leap rather than the other way around.
- The Super Galaxy Knights universe focuses a lot on inclusivity/diversity.

Here is the planned game flow:

- Player uses magic wand tool to start game & navigate to chapter.
- Player reads through comic panels.
- Player can walk up to panels & look inside. If a panel is in a wall, player can grab & move it.
- After the scene concludes, the game prompts the player to perform some task. e.g. , shoot virtual targets with a magic bow.
- Once the player has completed the chapter, they are shown their score, and unlock the next chapter. Score is framed as “money earned” in the story context.
- Player can play the chapter again for a better score, or move on to the next chapter.

The planned story:

_Diamis Artene is a reformed assassin who is looking for honest work to support her family. She is called in by Ty Kuna, a wealthy tech CEO, to work for his team of bodyguards. However, she soon finds out that Ty may not be the sort of person worth protecting..._

Some game precedents:

- Dr. Grordbort’s Invaders, a Magic Leap One shooter game. It has fun arcade gameplay, but doesn’t really have a story. The game shows that it's important to work around ML1’s field of view - use audio cues & visible indicators to show where the enemy is (although players still complained about the FOV issues regardless).
- Madefire Comic App, a Magic Leap One app. The app has MR comics, with sounds & some animation. The comics are nice, but they're not 3D.

The Capstone Advisor for the project is [Lindsay Grace](https://professorgrace.com/).

The current prototype has the first half of the first chapter of the game. It demonstrates menu, comic panels, archery gameplay, & scoring. There is currently no audio, but there is controller feedback. 

Here is the feedback from the prototype:

- Controls aren’t obvious to a first-time user of Magic Leap.
- Magic Leap sometimes messes up hand tracking or controller tracking.
- Bow is inside FOV when shorter players hold out hand.
- Targets are often outside the FOV, and the player doesnr't know where to look.
